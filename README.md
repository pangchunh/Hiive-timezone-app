# Github Actions
This repository has been integrated with Github Actions. It will run the Playwright test with each push to the ’timezone-app’ folder to ensure continuous quality assurance.

# Issues
During the QA process, I have encountered over 10 issues which I have documented as issues in this repository. I approached these with a high level of detail to ensure that they provide enough context for developers to understand and address them effectively.

# Automated testing
I have created 18 automated tests covering the expected functionality and responsiveness of the application. Given that there are ongoing bugs within the app, some of the tests (8 of them as of 16 Jan) will fail when you run them.
